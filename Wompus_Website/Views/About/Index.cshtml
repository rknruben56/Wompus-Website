        Wompus is a garage rock band from the southwest side of Chicago, all about dirty hooks, grunge and Busch Light.

    <h3>
        Wompus was born in the summer of 2013. Mitch, Mike, Alex and Ruben are all veterans of various mediocre rock bands from around the city. A shared passion for hard-driving, fuzz-addled scuzz rock in the vein of Nirvana brought them together and they have been banging around ever since. Equal parts grunge, bubble gum pop and heavy metal, theirs is a sound raucous and wacky indeed.
